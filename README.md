# Socket-Scanner-
Socket Scanner is a Python tool that scans ports 50-85 on a target IP address. It checks for open ports, displays results in real-time with a loading animation, and logs them to a file (`scanner_data.txt`). Simple to use via command-line arguments. Ideal for network troubleshooting. MIT License.
